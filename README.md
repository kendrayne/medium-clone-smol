# Hiya! :) This is my attempt at making a medium.com inspired clone. 
On our first week of learning HTML/CSS, we were given a project to clone a website from the examples we were given.
I loved Medium's layout; I'm a huge fan of contemporary, clean, and chic looking designs. I felt that Medium would be a
great start for me to practice that style! Initially, I thought it was going to be one of the easier websites to clone...
As a beginner in HTML/CSS, I've definitely underestimated the amount of meticulous detail that has gone into this gorgeous site.

It has so far been a wonderful learning experience! I've been able to experiment with different approaches to making things work and 
look (subjectively) nice. Since I've already put in so much time towards this project, I'm going to be  using it as a tangible progress tracker to 
apply any and all skills I learn at App Academy - sort of like a coding diary, I suppose! :) 

Some custom elements are inspired from a cult-classic MMORPG from the early 2000s: Ragnarok Online. It's been my favorite game since I was 4, so it's 
been fun to throw pieces of myself into this too.  ![poring](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94583385/166119032-8a5bb748-5803-4bd6-b276-466cb0a0a636.gif)





I will be pushing my progress to the following link provided. Feel free to take a peek at it, and of course, any and all feedback is welcome!
